For simplicity, I set a fixed price of R120 for each item. This straightforward pricing approach keeps things easy to manage in the early stages of the app’s development. Later on, if you decide to offer items at different prices, you could add variable pricing to make the app more dynamic. However, the fixed price currently provides a clear and consistent user experience, which is helpful for both users and developers while the app is in development. 

In addition to adding items, I created a dedicated checkout screen that displays the items in the cart and calculates the total cost. This is an essential feature, as it gives users a clear summary of their order before they proceed to pay. Displaying a list of items along with the total cost improves transparency and allows users to double-check their order, which enhances trust in the app. 

I also set up a CartManager singleton class to handle the cart's data across different screens. This means that the cart’s contents are managed in one place and can be accessed from any screen, making the app’s code more efficient and reducing the complexity of passing data between activities. By centralizing the cart management, you've ensured that the app is easier to maintain and that the user’s cart is always accessible. 

Finally, the app's design is user-friendly and intuitive. By setting up each item image with click functionality to add that item to the cart, I created a simple interaction that feels natural for users. This design choice makes the app more accessible, allowing users to easily add items with a single tap. 

Overall, the improvements you've made to the app lay a strong foundation for a functional and easy-to-use food ordering platform. With features like organized screens, an interactive cart, a consistent pricing model, a clear checkout process, and centralized cart management, your app has all the essentials for a great user experience. In the future,  I could continue to enhance it by adding features like item removal, custom pricing, or payment integration, which would make the app even more versatile and user-friendly.
